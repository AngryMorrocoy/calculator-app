## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
- **Bonus**: Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser

### What I learned
I used this little project to learn the basics of sass (absolutely loved it), also learned a little
trick for styling of radio buttons that I applied to the theme selector.

### Useful resources

- [How to create a custom checkbox and radio buttons](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_custom_checkbox.asp) - This helped me for styling the radio buttons.
- [Sass docs](https://sass-lang.com/documentation) - I'm learning Sass, so the docs were very useful.
